          Hailing from the "City of Progress" Gweru, Zimbabwe! Growing up I dreamt of the Gweru that could be but,
          it did not take me long to realise that everyone had the same dream and noone seemed to be doing anything to take us there, and that's when I decided to take matters into my own hands.
          For the longest time I longed to transform my community through engineering which has led me to pursue an electrical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. When I am not thinking about 
          how I will change Zimbabwe, I play sports, chess, and I love playing with my baby brother.

          Starting last year I embarked on a journey to provide a platform for the underappreciated arts in Zimbabwe 
          so to raise awareness and motivate people to venture into the these disciplines. Together with three of my friends we started Zimries- 
          Zimbabwean Diaries, a platform where people can share their poetry, articles, speaches and bring the Zimbabwean voice to the world. Inspired by 
          by the work people were doing and the change and influence they were having in society, I wanted to also bring myvoice to the world and make an impact.
          I wrote my first article, <a href="https://zimries.wordpress.com/2020/09/04/the-africa-we-want/">My African dream</a>. This marked the beginning of my journey as a writer, but I soon
          realised I did not like writing and was also the end.

         My journey as a programmer has been most fulfulling. Nothing compares to the feeling that mauls you after spending an entire night
         awake working on the SPS portfolio and are finally done. Although painful, there is a silver lining to these sleepless nights,
         every hour spent working on the projects, homeworks, and assignemnt means more knowledge and experience gained. Some of the projects I 
         have worked on are:
      </p>

           &nbsp &nbsp •	Built an object-oriented Rapid Roll game using Java to implement the backend and Java swing library to implement the frontend<br>
           &nbsp &nbsp •	The goal of the project was to get to accustomed to managing a project from ideation to design and implementation, and to gain more experience with backend and frontend development in Java<br>

         <br>Paint (CIS 120– Programming languages and techniques)<br>
           &nbsp &nbsp •	Used Ocaml to develop the backend and GUI of a paint application (similar to Microsoft paint)<br>
           &nbsp &nbsp •    Gained experience working with graphics contexts in Ocaml, implementation of various data structures such as: stacks, queues, heaps, etc and I also got exposure to backend and frontend development in Ocaml<br>
         <br>Penn Electric Racing <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp•	Worked on the electrical hardware team (16 people) to build and debug circuits, and design PCBs to be used in building an electric race car<br>
